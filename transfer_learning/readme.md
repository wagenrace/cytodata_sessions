## Summary

Transfer learning is the idea that knowledge from a task can be transfer to a new task.
A piano player would pick up the guitar faster then somebody without musical knowledge.

The same holds true for neural networks. A network that is already trained on [image-net](http://www.image-net.org/) will have a lot of basic features than are useful for an other task.

In the notebooks imagenet_to_food101 and imagenet_to_malaria_blood_cells there are examples of the benefits of transfer learning from a network trained on imagenet.
